# Spare
Theme for Emulationstation and RetroPie


##About

I wanted to make a tutorial for how to make a theme, so I needed to create a simple theme. This theme is it.

Spare is a simple clean theme used to show people the basics of theme creation for Emulationstation and RetroPie.

This theme is based loosely on the default Carbon theme by Eric Hettervik ([Rookervik](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/user/rookervik)), but all the XML was created from scratch.

##Artwork

- All Logo graphics are from the default Carbom theme made by Eric Hettervik.
- All screenshot artwork owned be their respective owners.


##Notes

- This theme has not been tested with a 4/3 ratio. You may come across some ugliness with the metadata on the Detailed view.
- This theme probably won't look very good on smaller screens (such as hand-helds) due to the amount of content on the Detailed View.
- There is also space left at the bottom of the metadata area for the Child-Friendly icons, but they are giving me grief, so have left them out for now.
