Please note:

Although there's no LCDproc daemon available for MS-Windows, it's possible to specify a hostname or IP-address of an LCDd daemon on the network to display artist and track information on an LCD.

See the configuration files in the 'config' subdirectory where NymphCast Server is installed.

There's a shortcut in the Start menu to explore to the 'config' folder.
