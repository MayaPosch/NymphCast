Haiku build notes for NymphCast Server

---

-> Use /boot/system/non-packaged/develop/{headers/lib} for the NymphRPC & libnymphcast headers & libs when installing them from locally compiled sources and not a package.

-> Haiku lstat is 64-bit clean, just like FreeBSD: lstat64 instances should be changed to lstat.

-> Always update packages with 'pkgman update' before anything else.

-> Network library is libnetwork => -lnetwork

Old issues:

- Link error: -lpostproc -lstdc++fs -lasound
	=> remove all three -> FIXED

Current issues:

- Crash on start: Poco::IOException: I/O Error 
	=> In 'Poco::Net::SocketImpl::setOption.
	=> (from strace:) setsockopt(0x5, 0x29, 0x1e, 0x[..], 0x4) operation not supported
	-> terminate called.
	=> apparently due to lack of Datagram socket support in Beta 4.
