Haiku build notes for NymphCast Server

---

-> Use /boot/system/non-packaged/develop/{headers/lib} for the NymphRPC & libnymphcast headers & libs when installing them from locally compiled sources and not a package.

-> Haiku lstat is 64-bit clean, just like FreeBSD: lstat64 instances should be changed to lstat.

-> Always update packages with 'pkgman update' before anything else.

-> Network library is libnetwork => -lnetwork

----

Old issues:

- Link error: -lpostproc -lstdc++fs -lasound
	=> remove all three -> FIXED

- Crash on start: Poco::IOException: I/O Error 
	=> Starts with bind6() call (NymphServer::start()).
	=> In 'Poco::Net::SocketImpl::setOption. (IPv6-only?)
	=> (from strace:) setsockopt(0x5, 0x29, 0x1e, 0x[..], 0x4) operation not supported
	-> terminate called.
	=> possibly due to lack of/incomplete Datagram socket support in Beta 4 & 5.
		=> https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/18204
	=> Using Poco::Net::ServerSocket::bind() instead seems to work.

- NyanSD discovery fails with "Failed to convert remote IP to local."
	=> IP to convert: 192.168.31.131 (Haiku VM IPv4)
	=> Converted IP: 0x831fa8c0
	=> Bug NyanSD: mixed up IPv4/IPv6 sections (nyansd.cpp:440 - 470)
	=> Haiku only has IPv6 loopback, no local IPv6 address.
	=> NyanSD discovery works after fixing NyanSD bug (see above).

Current issues:
		
- Install .so files into /boot/system/non-packaged/lib ?
